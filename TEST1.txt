1.EXPLAIN:

   1. public static void main(String arg[])
  
    Its main method where the program flow starts and the program access the differnt classes 
    if req in the program based on the requirement of a given programme.
    
    public is the keyword which defines the accesibility of the data within.
    static is also a keyword which defines the type of variable the main is.
    void specifies the the type of data the main method return at the end of the program main.
    
  
   2.class and object
  
    A class is a blueprint or a virtual structure consisting of set of codes with states and 
    behaviours that are variables and methods in a programme. 

    An object is a instance of class.
    Its a copy of class which acts similar to a class at given instance of time.

 
   3.JVM,JRE,JDK
  
    JDK - JAVA DEVELOPEMENT KIT 
    JDK is the component of java which provides the enviroment to built applications and 
    components in a java programme.

    JRE - JAVA RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT
    JRE is the component of java which is the underlying component that communicates 
    between a java programme and the operating software.

    JVM - JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE
    JVM is the component of java which reads,verifies,interprets and displays the byte 
    code of a java programme given from the java compiler of the JDK.


4.EXPLAIN THE CONSTRUCTOR AND ITS TYPES:

  Constructor is a special type of method which has the same name as the class name and 
  has no return type and can have parameters or no parametes in the paranthesis.

  there are 2 types of constructors ;
  a. Defualt constructor: defualt constructor are created when an object is created and
     this constructor does not have any parameters.

  b. Parameterized constructor: parameterized cvonstructor are defined by the developer
     where the constructor consists of some parametes in it.


5.DIFFERENCE BTW this keyword AND this()

  this -- this is a keyword which differentiates between parameterized variables and other
          variables in a java programme.
  
  this() -- this() is a predefined method in java.


7.WHY MAIN METHOD IS STATIC AND EXPLAIN THE METHOD TYPES.

  The main method is made static because the static data is accessible throughout the class 
  easily and is active till the end of the java code.
  
  The types of methods are;
  a. Userdefined methods
     Userdefined method are the methods which are defined by the user to perform certain 
     fuctionality or operations in the java programme as required by the user.

  b. Predefined methods
     Predefined methods are the methods which are already defined by the java so as to make
     code simpler to the user and reducing the number of lines of codes by the predefined methods.


9.WHAT IS JAVA CLASS LOADING AND EXPLAIN JAVA CLASS LOADER.
 
   Java class loading is the process in which the .class file also known as the byte code comes onto
   the JVM from the JRE where the J compiler converts the .java file to .class file and is passed 
   onto the JVM. Then the JVM loads all the byte code onto it and then sends it to read ,verify and 
   interpret the code. The JVM alone performs operation of loading,reading,verifying,and interpreting
   the byte code also know as .class file . In java JVM is called as the .class loader



10.CAN WE HAVE PRIVATE CONSTRUCTOR AND CAN WE OVERLOAD THE CONSTRUCTOR EXPLAIN WITH EX


   We cannot have a private constructor in java.
   The reason is constructor created when an object is created and an object is an instance of class or
   a copy of class. So the class is always has public accessibility so due to this reason we cannot have
   a constructor with private.
